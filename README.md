Quantum Honeypot Concept Simulation
Overview

This project simulates a Quantum Honeypot concept using Qiskit and Python.
It demonstrates how quantum properties like superposition and entanglement could be used to detect malicious activity or key sniffing attempts in a simulated environment.

Features

Simulates a quantum honeypot environment.

Detects attack attempts using quantum measurement principles.

Visualizes results with plots and graphs.

Useful for learning quantum cybersecurity concepts.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/i-vishwa/Quantum-Honeypot-Concept-Simulation.git
cd Quantum-Honeypot-Concept-Simulation


Install dependencies:

pip install qiskit matplotlib numpy pandas

Usage

Run the main Python script:

python quantum_honeypot.py


The script simulates quantum states and detects intrusion attempts.

Outputs include console logs and optional graphs.

Output

Measurement results of qubits

Graphical representation of attacks and detection

Sample output images are in the output/ folder (if added)

Principles Used

Superposition: Qubits exist in multiple states until measured.

Entanglement: Qubits act as a single system, allowing detection correlations.

Quantum Measurement: Collapse of qubits reveals intrusion patterns.

Applications

Quantum cybersecurity research

Honeypot-based intrusion detection simulation

Educational tool for quantum computing concepts in security
